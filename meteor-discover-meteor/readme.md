Ahead of a [Meteor London](http://www.meteorlondon.com) workshop, I decided to make my way through [Discover Meteor](https://book.discovermeteor.com/) to make sure I understood the core ideas and wasn't rushing to catch up all day!
Below are some notes I made throughout.

* `meteor add mizzao:bootstrap-3` adds the Bootstrap framework
  * This could be added as usual by including its files in our project but this way the package keeps it up to date
* `meteor add underscore` adds [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), a javascript utility library
