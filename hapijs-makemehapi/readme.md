These files show the work done around the _makemehapi workshopper_ tutorials.

You can install these yourself and work through them by typing the following into your terminal:
`npm install makemehapi`

Once that has installed you can run the workshopper by typing `makemehapi` into the terminal.

I fill my files with explanatory comments so if you need to look at the solutions for inspiration or need a little more detail on the thinking behind the code, please do take a look.
