In Juy 2014, the [hapi.js website](http://hapijs.com) was updated with [new tutorials](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/). I was trying to write some views at the time in a way that was slightly more complicated than the [makemehapi workshopper](https://github.com/spumko/makemehapi) or any of the existing examples I could find online allowed for.

I noticed that the tutorial on the hapi website _included a number of options I hadn't seen before_, so I decided to follow along.
As ever, I have *commented the code throughout*, so it should have enough information to be self-explanatory.

More examples of using the handlebars module for views with hapi [can be found here](https://github.com/spumko/hapi/tree/master/examples/views/handlebars).
